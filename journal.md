## Journal

### Day 4: January 15, 2022

Saturday

My interim #100DaysOfCode Update:

The first half of January was not as good as I planned. There were a lot of interruptions and I could not manage to do even the minimum.

I started the new year with a lot of hopes that I could spend 30 minutes a day coding something useful.

But, I couldn't progress much last week. Anyway, this is not the time to rationalize or justify.

In the previous attempt of my #100daysofcode (in Oct), I could code for 21 days without a break.

I built my resume website, Github landing page then.

Learnt new concepts in Git that I documented as blogs.

I got into dev communities around that time & that environment helped me sustain for 3 weeks without breaks.

December 2021 was the worst month for me ever since I started to learn React.

I did NOT move an inch during December. But, that month helped me sort out some issues & clear the path.

I did NOT progress much in the first 2 weeks of January.

It's high time to make a change and speed up.

Some measures that I'd be taking:

- Cutting out all non-tech social media presence
- Posting my daily progress on Twitter without fail & logging it
- Blogging at least once in a week
