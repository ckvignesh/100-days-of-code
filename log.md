Building my React & Firebase 'Productivity App' Project.

It was great to do a React project after long. I may stay up tonight & set the backend.

Created a github issue for that on the Repo.
Completed 51% of the Learn Git by building an SQL Reference Object.
Though I have used Git for close to a year, concepts like stashing and rebasing were the new lessons for me.
