# 100 Days Of Code - Log

***
### Day 0: October 25, 2021

**Today's Progress:**
- Finished the CSS Part of RWD Certification on freeCodeCamp.
- Finished Flexboxfroggy Level 24.

**Thoughts:** 
- This was a bit challenging. But, I could go through this quite soon because I had some experience with CSS before.
- I had completed 23 levels of FlexboxFroggy before. But I was stuck at the 24th level. Today, I completed it and made it as a Repo with proof.

### Day 1: October 26, 2021

**Today's Progress:**
- Finished 28/52 in the Applied Visual Design of RWD Certification on freeCodeCamp.
- Finished all the levels of Grid Garden game.
- Learnt that "***" is used for drawing a line in the markdown.

**Thoughts:** 
- Some concepts were totally new for me. I also realized that I made some stupid mistakes due to leaving extra spaces. 
- I completed all 28 levels of Grid Garden. But I was stuck at the 28th level. I had to take some help to understand it better. I faced difficulty in the 26th level too but I could solve it on my own. Therefore, I will repeat the last few levels of this game again tomorrow.

### Day 2: October 27, 2021

**Today's Progress:**
- Finished 30/52 in the Applied Visual Design of RWD Certification on freeCodeCamp.
- Made an Open Source contribution in the Open Product Management Repo.
- Studied the use of Var, Let and Const in JS.

**Thoughts:** 
I could do only one hour of coding today. It was a low in my graph of this challenge. Nor did I play any code game.
- Learnt how to use the Hue and transparency adjustments in CSS from the freeCodeCamp course.
- Made my second Open Source contribution in the Open Product Management Repo. Added some missing links and raised a PR. Waiting for its status to get updated.
- Var is globally scoped, Let and Const are block scoped. Var can be declared and updated but it can mess with the code if its a longer one as the values may get messed up. Let and Const are preferrable. Let can be updated but not declared again and it need not be initialised. Const cannot be updated or declared again and it needs to be initialised.
