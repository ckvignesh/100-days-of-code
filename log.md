# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: October 25, 2021

**Today's Progress:**
- Finished the CSS Part of RWD Certification on freeCodeCamp.
- Finished Flexboxfroggy Level 24.

**Thoughts:** 
- This was a bit challenging. But, I could go through this quite soon because I had some experience with CSS before.
- I had completed 23 levels of FlexboxFroggy before. But I was stuck at the 24th level. Today, I completed it and made it as a Repo with proof.

### Day 1: October 26, 2021

**Today's Progress:**
<!-- - Finished the CSS Part of RWD Certification on freeCodeCamp. -->
- Finished all the levels of Grid Garden game.

**Thoughts:** 
<!-- - This was a bit challenging. But, I could go through this quite soon because I had some experience with CSS before. -->
- I completed all 28 levels of Grid Garden. But I was stuck at the 28th level. I had to take some help to understand it better. I faced difficulty in the 26th level too but I could solve it on my own. Therefore, I will repeat the last few levels of this game again.
