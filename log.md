### Day 1: October 25, 2021
Monday

**Today's Progress:**
- Finished the CSS Part of RWD Certification on freeCodeCamp.
- Finished Flexboxfroggy Level 24.

**Thoughts:** 
- This was a bit challenging. But, I could go through this quite soon because I had some experience with CSS before.
- I had completed 23 levels of FlexboxFroggy before. But I was stuck at the 24th level. Today, I completed it and made it as a Repo with proof.

### Day 2: October 26, 2021 
Tuesday

**Today's Progress:**
- Finished 28/52 in the Applied Visual Design of RWD Certification on freeCodeCamp.
- Finished all the levels of Grid Garden game.
- Learnt that "***" is used for drawing a line in the markdown.

**Thoughts:** 
- Some concepts were totally new for me. I also realized that I made some stupid mistakes due to leaving extra spaces. 
- I completed all 28 levels of Grid Garden. But I was stuck at the 28th level. I had to take some help to understand it better. I faced difficulty in the 26th level too but I could solve it on my own. Therefore, I will repeat the last few levels of this game again tomorrow.

### Day 3: October 27, 2021 
Wednesday

**Today's Progress:**
- Finished 30/52 in the Applied Visual Design of RWD Certification on freeCodeCamp.
- Made an Open Source contribution in the Open Product Management Repo.
- Studied the use of Var, Let and Const in JS.

**Thoughts:** 
I could do only one hour of coding today. It was a low in my graph of this challenge. Nor did I play any code game.
- Learnt how to use the Hue and transparency adjustments in CSS from the freeCodeCamp course.
- Made my second Open Source contribution in the Open Product Management Repo. Added some missing links and raised a PR. Waiting for its status to get updated.
- Var is globally scoped, Let and Const are block scoped. Var can be declared and updated but it can mess with the code if its a longer one as the values may get messed up. Let and Const are preferrable. Let can be updated but not declared again and it need not be initialised. Const cannot be updated or declared again and it needs to be initialised.

### Day 4: October 28, 2021 
Thursday

**Today's Progress:**
- Solved all 12 Levels of Flexbox Defense Game.
- Reviewed and accepted some Open Source contributions.
- Made an OS Contribution.
- Added some features to a public Repo.
- Learnt about the break tag and code notation(``) in Markdown.

**Thoughts:** 
- After enough practise, CSS Games have become easy to solve. Now I must focus more on making some real projects. I can schedule games for weekends or during any other free time.
- I got a PR from an online friend who's also studying coding with me. Doing Open Source has taught me a lot and I could also review and edit code, handle issues and merge the PR.
- I added a small part to the documentation by specifying that the program could be run on any port by adding the number before it.
- I forked a simple quiz repo and added some features to it (like change in score patterns). It was in Next Js and Tailwind CSS. Though I knew nothing about both, I was able to handle it since I had worked on CSS and React before. I also raised an issue regarding this.
- The Open Source Contributions also taught me about the break tag and the coding format (``). This was from the contributions in the PRs I got.

- The Pull Requests: ![](Photos/Pull%20Requests%201.png)

### Day 11: November 4, 2021 
Thursday

Felt burntout as I spent most of today's first half coding. Learnt to use the automated kanban board in Github Projects. Started one for my portfolio and resume page after I finalised my themes and another to work on my Github Landing Page.
It looked like this before I started work on my Jekyll websites <br /> ![](Photos/Github%20Page.png). Here, CSS was the most used language. Now, things have changed due to my new projects. <br /> ![](Photos/Nov%204%20Github%20Page.png) <br /> But, I've decided to go ahead with React for my portfolio page. Only the Resume Page and the Under Construction Page will be in Jekyll.

**Today's Progress:**
- Built an Under Construction Page for my upcoming website.
- Started using Github Projects and learnt how automated Kanban works. Broke down tasks for Resume Page & Github Landing Page.
- Working on my resume page. Added data after studying the Jekyll Page Template. Have to make more customizations.

- Under Construction Page for my [upcoming website](http://ckvignesh.github.io/). Take a look, here: <br /> ![](Photos/Under%20Construction.png)
